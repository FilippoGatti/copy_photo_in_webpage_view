# copy_photo_in_webpage_view

If your are so crazy (like me) that you like to rename all your photos or pictures and then you want to find them fast: that tool should help you!

A python script scans your photos or pictures and creates a js object
Then in a webpage view (because code the graphic is more easy) you can search every image by his name and then copy it, if you need.
